The path will quickly lead you to the steepest climb of the route, and after that the climb flattens a little bit. On your right you will have an amazing view over Barranco Del Toro the whole climb.\nThe trail down is wider and easier to run than the climb, and takes you all the way down to another highway tunnel passage.
